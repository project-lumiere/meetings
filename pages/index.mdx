# 2. wtf is Lumiere, how does it work? :sparkles:

---

## Publication platform for STEM content

- \- best editing experience I've personally come across
- \- instead of being limited on the things you can embed, we have infinite possibilities with infinite React components
- \- Any iFrame (codesandbox, figma), components that have state, Graph (d3.js)
- \- Any React library can be provided in `MDXComponents.js`
- \- Customize everything, including output colors and custom tailwindcss classes

---

## Hashnode

## dev.to

<Image src="/dev.to.png" alt="Lumiere homepage" width={1100} height={550} />

---

## Sanity

<Image src="/sanity.jpg" alt="Lumiere homepage" width={1100} height={550} />

---

- \- but "STEM Content" is pretty vague => honestly speaking I am still not sure where to take this project with these editing capabilities
- \- ALWAYS open to new ideas about what to do here!
- \- I have a few ideas ahead

---

# 3. Clarifying niche + potential pivot :target:

---

## 1. Hashnode / dev.to competitor

- \- Compete directly with them => Lumiere as a CompSci publication platform, better editing experience
- \- Lumiere's features are best suited for CompSci publications
- \- We will need to invest in implementing the features that may them good => use your own domain DNS, a large community
- \- What stops Hashnode from using MDX? - @Arav - tbh nothing

---

## 2. Sanity.io + every CMS in the world competitor

- \- We would be only MDX cms on the market + a superior editing experience
- \- Does anyone have any idea how to build a cms? (rhetorical question)
- \- what stops another company from adopting mdx?

---

## 3. Publication platform for research / academic works

- \- unsaturated space
- \- debatable market demand...
- \- I believe our editor is more well-suited for CompSci

---

## 4. udemy => instead of video, documentation-like teaching?

- \- can monetize with Stripe
- \- see https://react2025.com, https://epicreact.dev
- \- can help creators with discoverability and easily create courses like these => no need to invest in traditional video equipment + the overhead that comes with it
- \- emphasis on practical project based courses?

---

## 5. open source editor as an `npm` package?

- \- can learn about open source and go star chasing

---

## Future plans

- \- grow a user base, iterate quickly based on their feedback
- \- grow a small and skilled team
- \- monetize?
- \- develop a special product for Hack Club
- \- maybe get acquired by a large company? (udemy, coursera?) Calix Huang has done it

---

## Going partially closed-source, for profit? 501c3 revoke?

- \- we have some close competitors => maybe close-source the website?
- \- open source a repository of React Components that can be used inside our editor

1. users can just write their own component and pr if they want to use it

- \- for profit / 501c3 revoke plan depends on which pivot we choose

---

# 4. Growth strategy, roadmap :ninja

<Image src="/anime-glasses.jpg" width={500} height={300} />

---

## For Lumiere to grow the whole team needs to be committed to

- \- building in public
- \- sharing bts
- \- handle customer feedback + iterate quickly on feedback cycles

# 5. Stalking potential teammates :shushing_face:

---

## Team should compliment each other

- Designer => imagine having Figma wireframes to work from
- Backend => database stuff
- Docker + knowledge about DNS + testing
- Familiar with our stack
- Interpersonal skills + passion >>>

# 6. Dev things to do :money_with_wings:

# Short term - higher importance rn

- \- Team page + Changelog/Releases + Blog
- \- `lumiere.codes/publications` page => should eventually be made home page (infinite scroll, SWR)
- \- Search features across site and also for publications (Algolia, Postgres full text search)
- \- Use PlanetScale's incredibly generous free tier (mysql) or another option
- \- mobile responsiveness
- \- Editor: support tailwindcss styling (super easy), insert components into editor using dispatches, toggle extensions, add remark/rehype plugins
